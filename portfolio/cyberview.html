        <p class="bio"> Cyberview is a game that was developed to be exploratory game design. For this, my role was
          mainly to develop a storyline for the game, as well as create many visual pieces. I also helped to conduct user testing.

          <br>
          The game is about a universe where all robots have high levels of intelligence, but this intelligence
          subdued by an object known as an inhibitor. These subdued robots are put to work in factories and we begin the game
          from the point of view of Android 241, a robot who's inhibitor has broken.

            The first step when took when undertaking this project was to sit down as a team and generate many ideas for a game that would fit the 'exploratory' prompt.
            After that step was taken and we had determined a general idea, we then began to narrow in on factors such as
            <b class ="interactBold"> 'what can our android do?',</b> <b class ="interactBold">'what does the factory look like?', </b>
            <b class ="interactBold">'what is the goal of the game'? </b>

          Through the process, we made sure to do user testing sessions with at least 3 players every week. During one especially
          valuable playtesting session, a player asked us why our main character was fighting against its fellow androids, if it is
          the humans in the game who are doing evil. This was
          an eye opener for us and we implemented this idea into our storyline, and also made the game possible to beat <b class ="interactBold"> without
          killing a single android. </b>

        <h2 class = "aboutme"> Challenges </h2>
        <p class = "bio">
        There were many challenges with this game which I played a large role in solving, as
        I worked majorly on the storyline. Many of our issues stemmed from making the game too difficult,
        as it may be easy for us due to repetitive actions. However, we solved many of these issues by
        identifying them through playtesting.
        <br> <br>
        However, playtesting was also a challenge, as it was difficult to navigate the feedback and determine
        which should be implemented and which should be put aside. Determining this is a valuable skill that I worked
        hard on developing during this project.

      <div class="eight columns">
        <h2 class="aboutme"> Reflection </h2>
        <p class="bio">
          There were some issues during the final playtesting
          session that was preformed by industry professionals, such as pickups of items being unclear, but the game
          was reportedly enjoyable, if too long to have been easily completed during the session. Upon reflection, I would have liked
          to have worked more on the code if I had the chance - two of my teammates were very skilled in C# and took that
          upon themselves. I would have also liked to have taken on more, if not all, of the visual design as well, time allowing.
          <br> <br>
          However, I also did enjoy my role as designing visuals, creating content and running user tests and ultimately I believe
          Cyberview was a success.
