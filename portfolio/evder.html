<!--
Does the introduction provide adequate background or context for our potential audiences?
Is the project described clearly and is the objective of the work explained?

Does the analysis clearly break down some of the necessary steps taken to create the work?
Are the steps sufficiently detailed, presented logically, and are thinking problems or design challenges explained?

Does the final reflection or evaluation present a thoughtful conclusion to the analysis?
Does it show why or why not the project was successful?

        required to only fulfill a set of technical requirements, the topic and content of our websites were left up to us. I wanted
      to come up with an attempt to <b class ="interactBold"> challenge Vancouver's image as a city without much excitement to it.</b> <br><br> From this came the
    idea of Evder: a website that collects all of the events that are happening in a city of your choice and displays them to you
  in one location. Users are able to sort the type of event they would like to go to by the city, type of event and price of the event. </p>

          because I wanted to keep track of which events were saved to the accounts of which users. <br> <br>
          It was not until later, when saying aloud my problem, that
          I realized that I was going about it all wrong.
          This lead to the creation of a new table in my database which stores the username of
          the user, along with the event id, to be able to access that event later. </p>

          If I were to do this again, I spend more time working on the design of my website
          as, at the time, I did not have enough time to work on the frontend side of the things.
          At the time, I had no experience with frameworks such as Bootstrap or React to have made designing
          the website easier.
          <br> <br>
          As the site is now, I’m proud that I managed to get all of the functionalities required to
          work as it took me a while to learn how to do so.
          Overall, I think I ended up learning a lot by struggling through various problems
          and figuring out how to solve them. Some parts definitely required me to step back and reexamine the issue
          in order to solve the problem and I feel that this made me more capable of handling such problems in the future.

Personal Reflection
I really enjoyed working on this site, I thought it was quite useful to learn concepts in class and then
immediately apply them to a project that ends up becoming quite large by the semester is over.
 I feel as though I have learned a lot of new things by doing this.
 If I were to do this again, I would like to spend more time working on the design of my website. Right now it is not very pleasing to look at as I did not have enough time to work on the CSS side of the things. I am also not familiar with things like Bootstrap or React to have made designing the website easier. As the site is now, I’m proud that I managed to get all of the functionalities required to work as it took me a while to learn how to do so.
One thing I did not like about working with AJAX is that it was often difficult to figure out where I was going wrong (see my second challenge). Rather than providing me a point of where the code was going wrong, I mainly had to guess via placing console.log’s everywhere to determine where the code was stopping. However, even that was not much help as the console log I had placed beneath data ran anyway, giving me the false assumption that I was putting the data inside of data correctly. Usually in other languages (Java), you are at least given a syntax error that helps you narrow down exactly what you did wrong. However, despite that, I liked the challenge of pining down exactly what the issue was and the triumph that came with finally having figured it out.
Overall, I think I ended up learning a lot by struggling through various problems and figuring out how to solve them. Some parts definitely required me to change my way of thinking in order to solve the problem (see my first challenge) and I feel that this made me more capable of handling such problems in the future.
